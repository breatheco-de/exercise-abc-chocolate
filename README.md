# ABC Cholocates (Online Store)

It's time to learn the workflow of designing a typical application or website! We know you may not be a designer, but you have to understand the design process and principles to be able to code it properly.

This exercise was design FOR DEVELOPERS (not designers), it contains all of what you need before starting to code.

## Instructions

For this exercise you are required to write the requirements and draw a wireframe for the client: Alan’s Best Chocolates.

## Specific objectives

##### 1) Read carefully the client requirements described in the following brief.

##### 2) Start by creating the website/application sitemap:

Think about all the  possible pages (home, login, etc.) and write them in a sitemap
[Here is a sitemap example](https://assets.breatheco.de/p/design/wireframing/other/online-store/img/sitemap.png)

##### 3) Continue by listing all the bootstrap components for each section in the sitemap:

One obvious component will be the navbar, 70% of the web applications have a navbar or a sidebar. Think about what else? Jumbotron, Card, Sections... Keep going!

##### 4) Draw the wireframe

Now that you know the components you will be using, its time to draw the wireframe! [Here is an wireframe example](./img/wireframe.png).

##### 5) You are done! The next step will be coding it!
