It's time to learn the workflow of a typical application/website. We know you may not be a designer, but you have to understand the design process and principles to be able to code it properly.

This exercise is designed for DEVELOPERS (not designers), it contains all of what you need before starting to code.

## Instructions

For this exercise you are required to write the requirements and draw a wireframe for the client's website: Alan’s Best Chocolates.

##### 1) Start by creating the website sitemap:

Think about all the possible pages (home, login, etc.) and write them in a sitemap.
[Here is a sitemap example](./img/sitemap.png)

##### 2) Continue by listing all the bootstrap components for each section in the sitemap:

Hint: One obvious component will be the navbar, 70% of the web applications have a navbar or a sidebar. 

What else? Jumbotron, Card, Sections... Use getbootstrap.com's showcase of components (documentation) to find inspiration.

##### 3) Draw the wireframe

Now that you know which components you'll be using, it's time to draw the wireframe! [Here is an wireframe example](./img/wireframe.png).

##### 4) You are done planning! Now start coding it!
