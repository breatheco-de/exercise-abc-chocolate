# Alan’s Best Chocolates - Briefing

Alan’s Best Chocolates (ABC) is leading the sales of chocolates and confections throughout the United States. While ABC’s sales have grown over the past 10 years, the rate of growth has slowed significantly. One key factor for this slowing growth rate is the shift of how clients are purchasing chocolates and confections, which is mostly online, that is why ABC is considering a move to create and provide an **online platform from which to sell its existing product line**.  ABC’s sales occur only in its brick and mortar facilities right now. 

The clients must be able to **purchase any of our current products**, being able to **browse them by category and type of chococlate**.

The shoping cart needs to be able to **make the buy process very easy** (3 clicks max).

The online store will replace the current online website, that is why we also need to be able to include pages of **institutional content and contact information**.

They expect over 60% of the traffic to be mobile, so a **mobile first** approach is a must.
