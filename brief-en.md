# Alan’s Best Chocolates

Alan’s Best Chocolates (ABC) is a leader in the sales of chocolates and confections throughout the United States. While ABC’s sales have grown over the past 10 years, the rate of growth has slowed significantly. ABC’s sales occur only in its brick and mortar facilities right now. One key factor for this slowing growth rate is the shift in the marketplace to purchasing chocolates and confections online, that is why ABC is considering a move to create and provide an **online platform from which to sell its existing product line**.

The clients must be able to **purchase any of our current product**, being able to **browse them by category a type of chococlate**.

The shoping cart needs ot **make the buy process very easy** (3 clicks max).

The store will replace our current online website, that is why we also need to be able to include pages for **institutional and contact information**.
